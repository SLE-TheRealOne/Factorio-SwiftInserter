# Factorio-SwiftInserter

### Purpose
Swift inserter is a mod for Factorio based on Simple_AOB ULtra Inserters mod wich added an upgrade to fast-inserter.

* Swift inserter is an ugrade of the base "fast-inserter"
* Both it's rotation and extension speed have been greatly enhanced
* It's unlocked by a new research "logistics-4"
* Building such inserter requires processing-unit and lubricant

Swift inserter is volontary both expansive (both research and build cost) and really fast => it's not made to replace **all** fast-inserters but to provide specific load/unload speed to some key factory points (such as train unloads or critical build machines)
